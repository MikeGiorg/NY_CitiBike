# NY_CityBike

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing Citi Bike bike-sharing data for New York City in 2022, with the goal of diagnosing distribution issues that impact bike availability and suggesting actionable solutions. As the lead analyst for this project, we explore how user behavior, station distribution, and weather patterns affect bike availability at various stations across the city.

The analysis will focus on:
Identifying the most popular starting locations for bike trips.
Detecting seasonal trends and demand fluctuations.
Pinpointing problem areas in station distribution (e.g., overcrowded stations or shortages).
Visualizing these insights with interactive and refined graphs to help the business strategy team make informed decisions.

## Data Sourcing
Citi Bike Data (2022): Publicly available trip data from Citi Bike, covering bike usage patterns across the city.
Weather Data (2022): Weather data sourced from NOAA's API, which will be used to identify correlations between weather conditions and bike usage.

## Analysis Criteria
Descriptive analysis of bike trips to find popular starting points and seasonal patterns.
Geographic plotting to identify problem areas in bike station distribution.
Exploration of common bike routes and the impact of weather on bike usage.

## Visualisation Criteria
Dashboard: An interactive Python dashboard will be used to showcase the findings. The dashboard will be divided into sections based on the variables affecting demand, including:
<ul><li>Popular starting locations</li>
<li>Seasonal demand patterns</li>
<li>Station distribution problems</li>
<li> Common bike routes</li></ul>

Each graph will be visually appealing and use a refined color palette in Python.
The dashboard will include an introduction, individual slides for each graph to avoid overwhelming the audience, and a page dedicated to strategy recommendations.
